With tuples, it is also safer in cases where the upstream code that generates the tuple might change and generate longer tuples in the future.\nTwo functions first_and_rest and first_second_rest to get both the first (two) element(s) and the rest of an iterable object.\nTwo functions firstarg and secondarg to get that simply return their first, resp. second, argument.","category":"section"}]
